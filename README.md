# HyperCube
HyperCube is a 3D building program that I have assembled, it runs on Windows 8 x86 minimum, it's a work in progress, it may need to prepare your system by installing some of it's packages before its first run, it will remain closed source while I am working on it. It has a few features, like a camera navigation menu, the 3D stage and a Properties panel used to create and manage objects. Have a go at it, its fairly easy to make stuff with it.
