# HyperCube
HyperCube is an interactive 3D building program that I have wrote in Python, it's a work in progress and is missing quite a bit of functionality. It has a few features, like a camera navigation menu, the 3D stage and a Properties panel used to create and manage objects. Have a go at it, its fairly easy to make stuff with it.

## Installation
Please ensure you have the latest version of Python downloaded and ensure you have Panda3D, Tkinter, Pillow and Logger installed, if you don't have these installed use the command:

pip install panda3d tkinter pillow logger

Then download HyperCube.exe and run it

## Usage
1. To start HyperCube run the HyperCube.exe.
2. Hypercube has a movement panel which is in the format of an extened D-pad which moves the camera along the X and Z axis, alongside that there are 2 buttons allowing vertical movement, represented by and up arrows.
3. HyperCube has a properties panel which allows for the creation and management of objects, all objects are cubes which can have the scale and position modified, each cube takes up 1 unit of measurement by default, objects can be used to create different structures which are navigatable with the camera.

## Sumary
Have a go at using HyperCube, it should be easy enough to use, and with that, enjoy!
