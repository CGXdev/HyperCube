# HyperCube
HyperCube is a 3D building program that I have wrote in Python, it runs on Windows 8 x86 minimum, it's a work in progress, it will remain closed source while I am working on it. It has a few features, like a camera navigation menu, the 3D stage and a Properties panel used to create and manage objects. Have a go at it, its fairly easy to make stuff with it.

## Installation
Please ensure you have the latest version of Python downloaded and ensure you have Panda3D, Tkinter, Pillow and Logger installed, if you don't have these installed use the command:

pip install panda3d tkinter pillow logger

## Summary
Have a go at using HyperCube, it should be easy enough to use, and with that, enjoy!
